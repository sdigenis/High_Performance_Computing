# High Performance Computing


This repository includes all the projects I have worked on HPC.<br>

It contains <br>
- An OpenMP program where VTune profiller was used to maximize the the perfomance of the application
- Two CUDA programs that maximize the GPU's traits to work in maximum settings giving the best possible output in the least time.

These were all assignments for the HPC University course.<br>

## Disclaimer 

There are possible better way of implementing these algorithms trying to achieve better running times.<br>
